<!-- How did you feel? -->
<u>Self assessment of how I felt this week:</u>

- My mood this week was encouraged  because I had gained a bit of understanding on the flow of the website even though my task was not merged
  
- Compared to last week, I feel more excited because I have achieved collectively more than the previous week.

- I find the project to be it challenges me 

- My level of stress is manageable
